# CS300 README

* What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The goal of this course was to learn about different data structures and analyze them for efficiency. The problem being solved was 
how to read a file containing course information, how to store that information in a data structure, and how to display that information.

* How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Depending on the problem at hand, certain data structures might be better than others in terms of speed and efficiency. The type of data being
handled needs to be inspected and the most applicable data structure should be used for that data. In this case, after doing run-time analysis
of the different data structures, I chose to approach the problem using the vector data structure.

* How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Whenever I run into a problem or roadblock, I always immediately search online to find help. I have learned to do this after many years of
banging my head against the wall trying to figure somethinig out myself, which is very painful and non-productive. Stackoverflow.com is
probably the most useful resource I use on a regular basis.

* How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I had never really thought about the run-time efficiency of data structures before. This project has helped me understand that it is important
to think about how the data will be used when designing a piece of software. Choosing the wrong data structure can significantly impact a program's
run-time negatively, and it is important to choose the correct one.

* How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I always try to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, but I do feel that the work done in this course has helped me
take that to the next level. Just having a deeper understanding of the main data structures can greatly enhance the maintainability of my code
because it should not be cumbersome to make changes if the correct data structure is used. I enjoyed working with these data structures a
great deal, and the things that I learned I will not soon forgot.
